# Test Recrutement

## To install

- Clone the project `git clone ...`
- Install dependencies with yarn
- run the folowing command to lauch the project `yarn dev`

## Motivations

- I used Vite.js as the bundler as it is a liable bundler/compiler. it has a Great support among browsers outof the box and doesnt require to add babel.
- For styling I use Styled-Components to have an easer handling of css.
- I did not install esLint or any helper library either.
- For the algorithm after some hours of me getting mad, I decided it would not be worth to reinvent the wheel and that I should get an already working algorythm, Thus I wasn't "that" far from the solution (relatively).
- I dont approve some part of the code but I figured it would be too long 
- I deleted the comments as it was not my code, but i can explain the tricky parts if needed
